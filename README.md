 # Smart-Water-Level-Indicator
# Arduino Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with Traffic Light LEDs

📌 Project Overview
          This project uses an Arduino Uno and an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to measure distance.
Based on the measured distance, 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) act like a traffic signal:

🔴 Red LED 
         → Object is very close (≤ 20 cm)
🟡 Yellow LED
         → Object is at a medium distance (21 cm – 300 cm)
🟢 Green LED
         → Object is far away (> 300 cm)
✅ Useful for Obstacle Detection, Parking Assistance, Smart Alert Systems

🛠️ # Components Required
